<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Sagar Bhatia</p>
<p>I’m someone who enjoys solving problems, learning deeply, and challenging myself with new ideas. I’ve always been curious about how things work and love breaking down complex concepts into simple, practical solutions.</p>
<p>I’m consistent, disciplined, and believe in giving my 100% to whatever I start. Creativity, persistence, and growth are values I carry in both my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>For me, coding isn’t just about writing lines of code — it’s about building, exploring, and creating something meaningful that can make an impact.</p>
